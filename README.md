> three-auto can quickly generate a Three.js scene through default configuration settings, without requiring users to manually declare basic classes like camera and renderer.

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://three-auto.vercel.app/)

## Install

```sh
npm install three-auto
```

```sh
yarn add three-auto
```
## Useing
Creating an auto-three instance, you need a canvas DOM root node or a virtual DOM node (supported by frameworks like Vue and React) to render the Three.js scene.

`html`
```html
 <canvas class="webgl" id="_scene"></canvas>
 <script type="module" src="./src/main.ts"></script>
```

`js/ts`
```ts
import * as AUTO from "../core";
import * as THREE from "three";
const canvas = document.getElementById('_scene') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const instance = new AUTO.ThreeAuto(canvas);
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(400, 400, 400);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: "#E89ABE",
  transparent: true,
});
const box = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
instance.scene.add(box);
instance.time.on("tick", () => {
  box.rotation.y = instance.time.elapsedTime;
});
```
